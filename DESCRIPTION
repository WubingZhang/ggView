Description: It is a basic issue to visualize the data in biological research, however 
        it is very challenging for many wet lab scientists. Here, we built the ggView 
        based on ggplot for elegant data visualization in R. The ggView includes multiple
        easy-to-use and practical functions for plotting figures for publication.
